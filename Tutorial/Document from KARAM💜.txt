Lnaguages used:
Java, xml

This Program implements second Problem described in the SKIDOS- Hackathon Problems
"Mobile/Web application with speech & text Processing"

This android app solves the problem as given in question and also demonstrated in video.
This app is able to solve if given input is in the form:
-- "What is fourteen divided two?"
-- "What is one hundred divide by 2"....along with "add","plus","added","multiplied","multiply" etc..types of word operators
-- "What is seventeen + 3"..along with -,/,-,* operators."
-- "How much 345 + 5", similarly with -,/,*, operators."
-- " tell me 14 gcd 56".. for greatest common devisor.
-- " show me 98 lcm 56".. for Least common factor.
-- This app is able to calculate more than 3 digit operands.
-- Speech to text is also implemented in this project but instead of direct processing the given string,
first it writes the sentence in text field and then if user want to change anything before processing he may do,
and then process the string and give the result.

NOTE: There could be any type of string but it must contain expressions and operands, and the operands 
must be on left and right side of the arithmatic expression as give above examples.
